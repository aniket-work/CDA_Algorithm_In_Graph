## Setting Up CDA_Algorithm_In_Graph Environment

To set up the `CDA_Algorithm_In_Graph` environment, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment using Python's built-in `venv` module:

    ```bash
    python -m venv CDA_Algorithm_In_Graph
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        CDA_Algorithm_In_Graph\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On Unix or MacOS:

        ```bash
        source CDA_Algorithm_In_Graph/bin/activate
        ```

3. Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt` using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
